==========================
dotcat - a dotfile manager
==========================

About
=====
dotcat is a dotfile manager, written in python. It came into existence because I wanted to have a way to manage my own dotfiles on my laptop and couldn't find a program that I liked enough. So I decided to write my own.

Design
------
TBD

Current status
--------------
This is very much WIP-0.0.1-PREALPHA(tm). It's just something I am writing for myself, but in the unlikely situation anyone is interested, feel free to get involved.

FAQ
===

**Why another program for dotfiles?**

I simply didn't find anything that was the way I wanted it to be. So I created this.

**Why use python and not XYZ?**

I considered using bash at first, but I am terrible at writing bash. Python I like, I can write reasonably good code in it and it's easy. So the answer is "personal taste".
